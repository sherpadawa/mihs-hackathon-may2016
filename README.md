MIHS ScriptEd Spring 2016 Hackathon

This project is a indie-game where you have to pick clothes from each of the seasons that the background shows.

We devided this project in 4 groups. The designers collected the clothes and the background images, and inseted them console. 
The project manager worked on the javascript, with score and assisted everyone. TThe researcher searched for the things or codes
that we might need help with and he searched fhow we move the objects . The developers worked on the movements of the objects and 
the randomness of the clothes.

When we were testing the game the clothes for the season didn't appear. So, we had to fix it. The background image for the western 
scene was not appearing. 

We learned new codes such as getBoundingClientRect, innerWidth etc.

We can add more clothing and we can do levelszaahhhw.
